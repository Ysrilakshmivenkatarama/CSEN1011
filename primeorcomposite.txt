2. accept a positive integer ( number greater than 2 )
3.intialize counter variable with 2
4. divide the number withe counter value.
5.if reminder is 0 display that 'n' is composite . and stop  the algorithm
6. else increment the counter and repeat from step 4. until the' counter' value is less than 'n'.
7. after completion of all the steps display that the number 'n' is prime
8. stop.
